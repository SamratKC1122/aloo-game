      <h1> Ok now I wil tell you guys about my gaming life.</h1>
      <p>Ok so my gaming life starts from 2015 when my dad had bought an smart phone for the first time. Actually I used to play games from before than that first smartphone 
      on my dads old nokia phone and I think you all have already predicted, and yeah that game is old nokia snake game. ok lets continue from that first smartphone. when the 
      first smartphone of our home got to me we were on my uncle's home in Dharan where my cousin sister downloaded me a game on that phone and the first game is Dr.Driving. 
      that was an legendary game and still the game is very good and enjoyable. Then in end of 2017 that phone got lost or messed I dont know exactly but after that I became 
      very sad and after a few months my dad bought another smartphone which is legendary "Samsung Galaxy j2 prime and i have played many games on that and that phone also lost 
      in 2019. And at exact year my uncle (from my mother side) came to Nepal from foregin and had also bought me an tablet as gift, and the tablet was from iLife (I forgort the 
      model😅). Then the real gaming starts . My uncle had bought me the tablet at february 2019 and I have downloaded multiple games on that. Then, my friend told me about 
      a game "Free Fire". Then I downloaded that and playes at april month 2019 and I still rember the event on free fire at that time, the event was 2nd anniversary. Then
      at 2022 my tablet got problem and I lost the hope to get that tablet fine. And at exact year my dad bougtht an another smartphone "Samsung Galaxy A22s" and I downloaded 
      Free Fire and played on that device and at the end of 2024 my mom bought an new smartphone "Samsung Galaxy A15" and I played Free FIre also on that device and created many contents.
      and at the starting months of 2025 I gave my 10th board exam and returned home and tried to play the game but I wasnt happy because my 5 years old id was hacked, I tried everything
      to recover but I failed. After that time I quit free fire and got to the capital city Kathmandu for further education. I am studying science at "Texas Int' collage" and while getting 
      to Kathmandu I didnt have a good device, I have had my Dad's old phone after that Galaxy j2 the "Samsung Galaxy A2 core" and I didnt play games for almost 5 months and I got my first 
      iPhone the " iphone 11" and I played many games on that and still that is my primary phone and I am still content creating on the device.</p>

       <div class="Cube">
         <h> My speedcubing journey.</h>
      <p>RUBIK'S CUBE is an cubical shaped item which was made to explain students about 3rd dimension and later that time it became an exciting puzzle toy and it is also world's most 
      selling toy.<br>
      Ok so this is the history of Rubik's cube. Now lets talk about me. So, I have started cubing when I was at 5th class and now I am at 11 calss. I wasnt sure about how to solve 
      that cube so I learned slowly and after a few month I got very good at solving cubes and my average was like about 2.5-3 minutes. And when I was at 8th class I thought about 
      doing speedcubing and try to do that 6-7 seconds solves on youtube and I tried to learn a lot but I failed to get less time than 1 minutes and 30 seconds, then I thought the problem 
      is in my cube. Then my sister bought me an QY speedcube which worth Rs.400 which is better than before because I usd to use an Rs.200 cube before that. Then I got perfect on that new 
      cube and got an average of 1 minutes and 20 seconds which is also very much, then I searched on youtube and I found the method I was using for beginners and then I learned CFOP method.
      then after a few months of practice I got an average of 1 minute and at that time I was at 10th class. Then I practiced a lot and I got and average of 50 seconds and I couldnt able
      to get less than that even with too much practice. Then I again thought about cube and I found that the cube I was using is actually not a speedcube because there were no magnets.
      Then when I got enrolled to 11th class I bought an new cube the " moyu RS3M V5 2023 version with dual adjustment" for Rs.1500 and with delievery cost the total price was Rs.1700.
      The cube was absolutely beast and I improved my fingertips for the cube and  now I finally got an average of 30 seconds and my fastest ever solve is 19.49 seconds. I am still working 
      to reduce time and my aim is to break the national record of Nepal which is 6.66 seconds. But for first my aim is to get sub 15 solves or average of 15 seconds.
