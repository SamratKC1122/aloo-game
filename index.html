      <h1> Ok now I wil tell you guys about my gaming life.</h1>
      <p>Ok so my gaming life starts from 2015 when my dad had bought an smart phone for the first time. Actually I used to play games from before than that first smartphone 
      on my dads old nokia phone and I think you all have already predicted, and yeah that game is old nokia snake game. ok lets continue from that first smartphone. when the 
      first smartphone of our home got to me we were on my uncle's home in Dharan where my cousin sister downloaded me a game on that phone and the first game is Dr.Driving. 
      that was an legendary game and still the game is very good and enjoyable. Then in end of 2017 that phone got lost or messed I dont know exactly but after that I became 
      very sad and after a few months my dad bought another smartphone which is legendary "Samsung Galaxy j2 prime and i have played many games on that and that phone also lost 
      in 2019. And at exact year my uncle (from my mother side) came to Nepal from foregin and had also bought me an tablet as gift, and the tablet was from iLife (I forgort the 
      model😅). Then the real gaming starts . My uncle had bought me the tablet at february 2019 and I have downloaded multiple games on that. Then, my friend told me about 
      a game "Free Fire". Then I downloaded that and playes at april month 2019 and I still rember the event on free fire at that time, the event was 2nd anniversary. Then
      at 2022 my tablet got problem and I lost the hope to get that tablet fine. And at exact year my dad bougtht an another smartphone "Samsung Galaxy A22s" and I downloaded 
      Free Fire and played on that device and at the end of 2024 my mom bought an new smartphone "Samsung Galaxy A15" and I played Free FIre also on that device and created many contents.
      and at the starting months of 2025 I gave my 10th board exam and returned home and tried to play the game but I wasnt happy because my 5 years old id was hacked, I tried everything
      to recover but I failed. After that time I quit free fire and got to the capital city Kathmandu for further education. I am studying science at "Texas Int' collage" and while getting 
      to Kathmandu I didnt have a good device, I have had my Dad's old phone after that Galaxy j2 the "Samsung Galaxy A2 core" and I didnt play games for almost 5 months and I got my first 
      iPhone the " iphone 11" and I played many games on that and still that is my primary phone and I am still content creating on the device.</p>
